# Background

According to WHO (World Health Organization)  : 
1. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar) that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves.
2. In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths (1).
3. About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year. Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past few decades.

Consequences of  Diabetes : 
1. Higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure.
2. Can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes (permanent vision), kidneys and nerves over time.
3. Problem with feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow that causing foot ulcers and may lead to amputation.

# Purpose
To find out and predict the probability for someone or especially patient predicted as diabetes or not according to the causing factors with a lot of steps such as data processing like resampling, hyperparameter tuning,  and models training for classification models on Machine Learning such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes using Python programming language in Google Colab.

In this project, we hope that we can evaluate the potential of model application for predicting diabetes in medical fields or even using real time data and help us to learn the implementation of the models and the impacts to support early diagnosis and diabetes handling for all people to keep healthy and fit.
